<td>Abstract</td>
<td> They speak on virtual reality in sports, how it not only allows safe training but you get complete control over what you want to do in training. As popularity continues to grow in the VR sports world, it's giving athletes the chance to program actual events in past games to immerse themselves in the action and fix their skills to be at the top of their game. Now as technology advances, VR can differentiate between professional players and beginners. This is a big step as it can train players to perform drills that won't lead to injury and still give them the training they need by allowing the players to practice in a realistic and safe environment.</td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td> In this article, talking about how VR is evolving quick in today's society. We can see more and more VR in sports now and in the future. We are already using VR in sports for training, recovery, and fan engagement. Using real game-like scenarios to sharpen players skills and decision making without having the pressure during a real game. You can get feedback from coaches on different positions or techniques without risking injury. Speaking on injury, injury recovery with VR has helped athletes perform exercises without risking long term problems. It can help build confidence as getting back into the game step by step. And fan engagement as you can experience sports from field view or even courtside making the experience feel more engaging and fun.                   </td>
